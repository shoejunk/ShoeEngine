I have uploaded two files that describe my C++ project:

1. `project_structure.txt`: This file contains the directory tree of my project, showing the structure of folders and files. Note that the `build` and `.git` directories are intentionally excluded.
2. `project_dump.txt`: This file contains the contents of important files in my project, including `.cpp`, `.h`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `.md`, and `.bat` files. Each file is labeled with `=== FILE: path/to/file ===` to indicate where each file begins.
